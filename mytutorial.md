Caring for your teeth is really important. Not only is it essential for your oral hygiene, it is a courtesy to those around you. Follow this basic tutorial for happy pearly whites. 

## 1. Buy the Proper Supplies 

* **Toothbrush**: It can be electric of manual, the softer the bristle the better.
* **Toothpaste**: The world is your oyster: mint, bubblegum, cinnamon. 
* **Floss**: Contrary to popular belief this is NOT optional.
* **Running Water**: Essential.
* **Optional: Mouthwash**: Swish swish the debris away. 

> **Tip**: Do not use a floss pick. The floss is pulled too tight and therefore will not successfully get in between your teeth. 
### ***Example***:
```javascript 
function buySupplies() {
    console.log("🛒 Heading to the store...");
    console.log("📌 Picking up a toothbrush, toothpaste, and floss...");
    console.log("💰 Paying for supplies...");
    console.log("🏠 Returning home with fresh supplies!"); 
} 
```

## 2. Hype Yourself Up 
**Tip**: Say some affirmations for positive and efficient experience 
### ***Example***:
```javascript 
function hypeYourselfUp() {
    console.log("🪞 Looking in the mirror...");
    console.log("💪 Giving yourself a pep talk...");
    console.log("🔥 Saying: 'You got this!'...");
    console.log("😃 Smiling confidently!");
} 
``` 
## 3. Just Do It
Stop overthinking it 
### ***Example***:
``` javascript 
function justBrush() {
    console.log("🪥 Grabbing the toothbrush...");
    console.log("🦷 Brushing teeth thoroughly...");
    console.log("💦 Rinsing and feeling fresh!");
}
```

#### Execute the brushing routine
``` javascript
buySupplies();
hypeYourselfUp();
justBrush();
```
